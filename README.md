1. General Information (Abstract)

This project investigates diachronic change in English pronoun usage, focusing on the relative frequency of singular they compared to the gendered pronouns he and she. Although the use of singular they has been present since the fourteenth century, its usage has increased substantially in recent decades. This study compares two time periods, 1990 and 2019, to examine how social changes related to gender and inclusivity are reflected in language use. By quantitatively analyzing pronoun frequencies across these periods, the project aims to contribute to a broader understanding of linguistic change and its social motivations.

2. Background Information

Singular they has a long history in English. The Oxford English Dictionary traces its earliest recorded usage back to 1375, demonstrating that it is not a modern invention but a longstanding grammatical option. However, its social relevance has increased significantly in recent decades due to changing attitudes toward gender identity and inclusivity.

Previous research has examined both the grammatical legitimacy and sociolinguistic significance of singular they.
Balhorn (2004) argues that singular they is grammatically well-formed and has been consistently used by native speakers despite prescriptive resistance.
Paterson (2014) shows that the use of singular they has increased in written English, particularly in contexts where gender is unknown or non-binary, reflecting broader social changes.

These studies suggest that the increased use of singular they is both linguistically motivated and socially meaningful, making it a suitable focus for a diachronic corpus-based analysis.

3. Research Question and Hypotheses
Research Question

How has the relative frequency of singular they increased compared to the relative frequency of he/she between 1990 and 2019?

Hypotheses

H1: The frequency of singular they is higher in the late period (2019) than in the early period (1990).
H2: The combined frequency of he and she is higher in the early period (1990) than in the late period (2019)

4. Method

This study adopts a corpus-based quantitative approach using data from the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA). COCA is a large, balanced corpus of American English containing texts from multiple genres, including spoken language, fiction, magazines, newspapers, and academic writing, making it suitable for diachronic linguistic analysis.

Two subcorpora are selected to represent English usage in 1990 and 2019. These years are chosen to capture changes in pronoun usage over a nearly thirty-year period.

The analysis focuses on identifying and counting occurrences of singular they and gendered pronouns (he and she). Instances of they are manually filtered to exclude clearly plural uses, ensuring that only singular references are included. The dependent variables are the relative frequencies of singular they and he/she, while the independent variable is time period (1990 vs. 2019).

Relative frequencies are calculated per million words to allow for accurate comparison between datasets of different sizes. The resulting frequency differences are analyzed to determine whether the observed changes support the hypotheses and reflect broader social shifts toward gender inclusivity in language use.
